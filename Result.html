                                        <p>・Construction of vesicles</p>
                                        <p>We observed vesicles with a fluorescence microscope (Figure2). These pictures were same ones.</p>
                                        <p> We found some sphere structures in the pictures. They were vesicles which contain some fluorescent dyes.</p>
                                        <p> The upper right vesicle was about 10 μm. We took 3 kinds of pictures. A was a normal microscope picture.</p>
                                        <p> B was a picture which shows calcein in the vesicles. We can see green fluorescence in the picture, it is calcein.</p>
                                        <p> C was a picture which shows rhodamine in the membrane of the vesicles. We can see red fluorescence in the picture, it is rhodamine.</p>
                                        <p></p>

                                        <p>・Plasmid purification</p>
                                        <p> Figure3 shows the result of electrophoresis ofafter the purified plasmid.</p>
                                        <p>From the left to right, there are 100bp ladder, two negative controls and the purified plasmid pET-lacZ of the size of 5Kbs.</p>
                                        <p>The plasmid was successfully purified. After plasmid purification, we measured the DNA concentration.</p>
                                        <p>Concentration of template DNA was 12ng/μl.</p>

<br />

<p>・Cell-free translation</p>
<p>The translation of gene production was performed and the activity of the product was detected according to the enzymatic assay.</p>
<p>We measured both samples and negative controls (N.C.) three times. We measured O.D.420 at 37℃ every 5 minutes for 1 hour.</p>
<p> The enzymatic reaction was monitored and showed as in The result was Figure 4.</p>
<p> Horizontal axis indicates the time after the mix of OPNG solution and translation product.</p>
<p> Vertical axis indicates O.D.420, and it represents the amount of the enzymatic product means the volume of o-nitrophenol.</p>
<p> The graphs of the samples significant increase in OD420 d significantly,</p>
<p> this result indicateds that lacZ was successfully are transcribed and translated in the PURE systemall samples. </p>
