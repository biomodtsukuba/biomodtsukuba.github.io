					<h2>Results</h2>
<p>・Construction of vesicles</p>
<p>We observed vesicles with a fluorescence microscope (fig.5).</p>
<p>We found some sphere structures in the pictures.</p>
<p>They were vesicles which contain some fluorescent dyes.</p>
<p>The upper right vesicle was about 10 μm.</p>
<p>We took 3 kinds of pictures. A was a normal microscope picture.</p>
<p>B was a picture which shows calcein in the vesicles.</p>
<p>We can see green fluorescence in the picture, it is calcein.</p>
<p>C was a picture which shows rhodamine in the membrane of the vesicles.</p>
<p>We can see red fluorescence in the picture, it is rhodamine.</p>
 <br />

 <br />
<p>・Plasmid purification</p>
<p>Fig. 6 shows the result of electrophoresis of the purified plasmid.</p>
<p>From the left to right, there are 100bp ladder, two negative controls and the purified plasmid pET-lacZ of the size of 5Kbs.</p>
<p>The plasmid was successfully purified. After plasmid purification, we measured the DNA concentration.</p>
<p>Concentration of template DNA was 12ng/μl.</p>
 <br />

 <br />
<p>・Cell-free translation</p>
<p>The translation of gene production was performed and the activity of the product was detected according to the enzymatic assay.</p>
<p>We measured both samples and negative controls (N.C.) three times. </p>
<p>We measured O.D.420 at 37℃ every 5 minutes for 1 hour.</p>
<p>The enzymatic reaction was monitored and showed in the fig. 7.</p>
<p>Horizontal axis indicates the time after the mix of OPNG solution and translation product.</p>
<p>Vertical axis indicates O.D.420, and it represents the amount of the enzymatic product means the volume of o-nitrophenol.</p>
<p>The graphs of the samples significant increase in OD420 d significantly,</p>
<p>this result indicated that lacZ was successfully are transcribed and translated in the PURE system in all samples.</p>
 <br />

 <br />
<p>・Gene expression switch</p>
<p>The result of electrophoresis of the PCR products is shown in fig 8.</p>
<p>Lanes 1-3 indicate the PCR product, a DNA control of 400-bp length, and a 100 bp ladder, respectively.</p>
 <br />
<img src="images/Figure8new.png" alt="Figure2.png" width="249" height="338" />
 <br />
<p>The second lane from the right is 100 bp DNA ladder.</p>
<p>The third lane from the right is control needed when performing PCR method, and as we know, it shows about 400 bp band. </p>
<p>The forth lane from the right is our primer which is performed PCR method.</p>
<p>Thus, a ~500 bp DNA sequence, containing both<I> rpsO</I> and self-regulation structure, was successfully generated.</p>
