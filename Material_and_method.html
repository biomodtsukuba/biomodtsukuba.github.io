<p>・Preparation of vesicles [1]</p>
<p>1. W/O emulsions were prepared by mixing emulsification.</p>
<p>Add 2.5ml of hexane solution (3wt% Span 80 and 0.1wt% stearylamine) to 0.5ml of 50mM Tris-HCl (0.01M calcein, pH8.0),</p>
<p>and mix them at 8000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature.</p>
<p>2. Freeze the emulsions by liquid nitrogen and keep them at -20°C.</p>
<p>3. Add the mixture of egg PC, cholesterol, stearylamine and rhodamine PE in the mole ratio of 5: 5: 1: 0.005 to hexane.</p>
<p>Import the hexane solution into the emulsion solution and export it three times, and replace surfaces of emulsions from span80 to lipid.</p>
<p>4. Add hexane to the emulsion solution, and keep it at －6℃, 20hPa to remove hexane. We used an evaporator.</p>
<p>5. Add 50mM Tris-HCl to it and produce the vesicle suspension.</p>
<p></p>
<br />
<p>・Microscopic observation</p>
<p>The prepared vesicles were detected by a fluorescence microscope (Olympus).</p>
<p>The inside of the vesicle was labeled with calcein that shows green fluorescence and the membrane was labeled with rhodamine that shows red fluorescence.</p>
<p></p>
<br />
<p>・Purification of plasmids</p>
<p>We transformed the plasmid pET-lacZ to the E. coli cells (JM109) by heat-shock method according to manufacturer’s protocol.</p>
<p>The E.coli cells contain the plasmids were selected according to the resistance to ampicillin.</p>
<p>The overnight culture were collected and the plasmids were purified with the QIAGEN plasmid purification kit,</p>
<p>and were confirmed by electrophorases with a 0.8% agarose gel.</p>
<p></p>
<br />
<p>･Measurement of DNA concentration</p>
<p>The concentration of the purified plasmid was measured using a fluorometer (Quantus, Promega) and the DNAONE kit, according to the manuafacter’s protocol.</p>
<p></p>
<br />
<p>・Cell-free translation</p>
<p>A component constituted cell free translation system, PURE system (PUREfrex®2.0, Gene Frontier), was used in the present study.</p>
<p>The translation reaction (50 μl) was performed at 37°C for 3 hours, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>
<p>The translation product was checked enzymatic activity assay.</p>
<p></p>
<br />
<p>･Enzymatic activity assay</p>
<p>The activity of the gene product of lacZ,  β-galactosidase, is evaluated by enzymatic assay, asβ-galactosidase, </p>
<p>catalyzes the substrate ONPG to o- nitrophenol, which can be detected at OD420.</p>
<p> 50μl of the translation mixture was added to 60 μl of 4 mg/ml ONPG and 490 ml of water. </p>
<p>The resultant mixture was loaded to to a 96-well plate (corning), and the reaction was performed at the room temperature.</p>
<p>The enzymatic reaction was monitored with a plate reader (Epoca 2, BioTek) and measured every 5 minutes for one hour.</p>
<p></p>
<br />
<p>・preparation of the sequence of the switch</p>
<p>The sequence of the gene expression switch was partially from the E. coli genome.</p>
<p>PCR amplification was perform to acquire the regulatory sequence and the rpsO gene,</p>
<p> with the primers of 5’-TTCCAGTGAATTGCTGCCGTC-3’ and 5’-TGGTTGAATACCCGGCGTAATG-3’ (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>
<p>The PCR reaction was carried out using Taq DNA polymerase (SIGMA) and with a thermal cycler (Dice Touch, TaKaRa).</p>
<p>The PCR product contained the structural gene rpsO and the self-regulation sequence, which functioned as a switch based on its secondary structures at RNA level. </p>
<p>The PCR products of this reaction was stained by Novel juice, and electrophoresis was performed using 0.7 % agarose gel.</p>
<p>The 100 bp DNA ladder (TaKaRa) was used as electrophoresis ladder.</p>
