					<h2 id="biol">Materials and methods</h2>
<p>・Preparation of vesicles [1]</p>
<p>1. W/O emulsions were prepared by mixing emulsification.</p>
<p> Add 2.5ml of hexane solution (3wt% Span 80 and 0.1wt% stearylamine) to 0.5ml of 50mM Tris-HCl (0.01M calcein, pH8.0),</p>
<p>and mix them at 8000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature. </p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Freeze the emulsions by liquid nitrogen and keep them at -20°C.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Add the mixture of egg PC, cholesterol, stearylamine and rhodamine PE in the mole ratio of 5: 5: 1: 0.005 to hexane.</p>
<p>Import the hexane solution into the emulsion solution and export it three times, and replace surfaces of emulsions from span80 to lipid.</p> 
<p></p>
<p>4. Add hexane to the emulsion solution, and keep it at －6℃, 20hPa to remove hexane. We used an evaporator.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Add 50mM Tris-HCl to it and produce the vesicle suspension.</p>
<p></p>

<p>･Microscopic observation</p>
<p>he prepared vesicles were detected by a fluorescence microscope (Olympus).</p>
<p>The inside of the vesicle was labeled with calcein that shows green fluorescence and the membrane was labeled with rhodamine that shows red fluorescence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>・Purification of plasmids</p>
<p> We transformed the expression plasmid of pET-lacZ to the E. coli cells (JM109) by heat-shock method according to manufacturer’s protocol.</p>
<p> The E.coli cells contain the plasmids were selected according to the resistance to antibiotics.</p>
<p> The overnight culture were collected and the plasmids were purified with the QIAGEN plasmid purification kit,</p>
<p> and were confirmed by electrophorases with a 0.8% agarose gel.</p>
<p></p>

<p>･Measurement of DNA concentration</p>
<p>The concentration of the purified plasmid was measured using a fluorometer (Quantus, Promega) and the DNAONE kit, according to the manuafacter’s protocol. </p>
<p></p>     
<p>・Cell-free translationA component constituted cell free translation system, PURE system (PUREfrex®2.0,Gene Frontier Corporation), was used in the present study.</p>
<p> The template DNA was the purified plasmid pET-lacZ.</p>
<p> The translation reaction (50 μl) was performed at 37°C for 3 hours, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>
<p> The translation product was checked enzymatic activity assay.</p> 
<p></p>


<p>･Enzymatic activity assay</p>
<p>The translation product β-galactosidase, the gene product of pET-lacZ, can catalyze the substrate ONPG to o- nitrophenol, which can be measured at OD420.</p>
<p>The productivity of the transcription-translation reaction can be quantified in accordance.</p>
<p>50μlof the translation mixture was then added with 60 μl of 4 mg/ml ONPG and 490 ml of water at the room temperature and loaded to three wells on a 96-well plate (corning).</p>
<p>The enzymatic reaction was monitored with a plate reader (Epoca 2, BioTek) and measured every 5 minutes for one hour. </p>
